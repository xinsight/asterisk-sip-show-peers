sip-show-peers

A useful command for monitoring asterisk SIP connections is "sip show peers". This
binary runs that command as root (or whatever process asterisk is running under) so
that any user can easily see the SIP status. (I find this useful as part of some
scripts that monitor the health of the server.)

An example of the output:

Name/username              Host            Dyn Nat ACL Port     Status               
iphone/iphone              (Unspecified)    D   N      0        UNKNOWN              
aastra1/aastra1            192.168.10.5     D   N      1025     OK (211 ms)   
aastra2/aastra2            192.168.10.5     D   N      1025     Unmonitored
